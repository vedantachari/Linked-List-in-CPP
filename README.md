# LINKED LIST IN C++
<h2>What is a Linked List</h2><p><b>Linked List</b> is linear data structure that consists of a collection of <ins><b>nodes</b></ins> where each node has <ins><b>data field</b></ins> that stores the required information and <ins><b>pointer</b></ins> that points to next nodes, i.e. it stores the address to the next node.</p><div align = "center"><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/n8xZW7y.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: auto;"> </div><h2>Why use Linked lists ?</h2><ul><li>Linked lists can change size dynamically unlike arrays which have a fixed predefined size, this makes them sutaible when the number of elements are constantly changing.</li><li>As the memory allocation is dynamic in Linked Lists, one can allocate and deallocate elements so there is no wastage of memory unlike arrays where memory allocation is static.</li><li>Insertion and Deletion in Linked Lists is eazy and effecient, unlike arrays there is no shifting of elements, If array is full then to add new element, you must create a larger array and then copy all elements which can me costly.</li><li>Linked lists also helps to implement other data structures like Stacks(Last-In-First-Out), Queues(First-In-First-Out), Graphs, Trees.</li></ul>
