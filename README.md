# LINKED LIST IN C++
<h2>What is a Linked List</h2><p><b>Linked List</b> is linear data structure that consists of a collection of <ins><b>nodes</b></ins> where each node has <ins><b>data field</b></ins> that stores the required information and <ins><b>pointer</b></ins> that points to next nodes, i.e. it stores the address to the next node.</p><div align = "center"><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/n8xZW7y.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: auto;"> </div><h2>Why use Linked lists ?</h2><ul><li>Linked lists can <ins><b>change size dynamically</b></ins> unlike arrays which have a fixed predefined size, this makes them sutaible when the number of elements are constantly changing.</li><li>As the memory allocation is dynamic in Linked Lists, one can allocate and deallocate elements so there is <ins><b>no wastage of memory</b></ins> unlike arrays where memory allocation is static.</li><li><ins><b>Insertion and Deletion</b></ins> in Linked Lists is <b><ins>eazy and efficient</b></ins>, unlike arrays there is no shifting of elements, If array is full then to add new element, you must create a larger array and then copy all elements which can me costly.</li><li>Linked lists also <b><ins>helps to implement other data structures</b></ins> like Stacks(Last-In-First-Out), Queues(First-In-First-Out), Graphs, Trees.</li></ul><h2>Types of Linked Lists</h2><ol><li><b>Singly Linked List : </b>It is a type of linked list in which each node contains only one link or address which points to the next node, the link field of the last node contains NULL which indicates the end of list.</li></ul><br/><div align = "center"><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/H8ZF56l.png"style="width: 800px; height: auto;"></div><br/><li><b>Doubly Linked List : </b>It is a type of linked list in which each node contains two links or address one points to the next node and other to the previous node, the previous link of the head node and the next link field of the last node contains NULL.</li><br/><div align = "center"><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/CYV377n.png"style="width: 800px; height: auto;"></div><br/><li><b>Circular Linked List : </b>It is a type of linked list in which the next link of last node contains the address of head or first node, hence the structure seems circular.</li><br/><div align = "center"><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/qnmdnpj.png"style="width: 800px; height: auto;"></div</ol>
